Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn: A Theoretical Overview

Data visualization is a crucial component of data analysis, providing visual insights that can help detect patterns, trends, and outliers. Two popular libraries in Python for data visualization are Matplotlib and Seaborn. They offer a range of plotting functions, from basic to advanced, and are often used together to create professional and informative visualizations.

1. Introduction to Data Visualization
Data visualization involves the graphical representation of data. It helps in understanding patterns, trends, and insights by transforming raw data into charts and plots. Python offers two popular libraries for this: Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Matplotlib: A flexible and powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers high-level functions for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher, is commonly used in data visualization tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width
